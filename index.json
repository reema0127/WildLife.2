        "Sri Lanka boasts a rich tapestry of wildlife, encompassing both its diverse flora and fauna thriving in their natural habitats. Remarkably, the country exhibits one of the highest rates of biological endemism, with 16% of its fauna and 23% of flowering plants being exclusive to the region. The most recent comprehensive update on Sri Lanka's biodiversity was presented in the 6th National Report of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This report, concluding at the end of 2018, offered an up-to-date inventory of species.",
        "However, subsequent to this report, 54 new species were meticulously documented in 2019. This impressive tally includes 26 spiders (comprising 14 cellar spiders, 7 jumping spiders, 4 crab spiders, and 1 tarantula), 1 scorpion species, 5 mites and ticks, 14 reptiles (13 day geckos and 1 snake), 1 shrub frog, 1 orchid, and 6 lichens. In a subsequent update in 2021, Professors Devaka Weerakoon and Amila Sumanapala released a revised list of taxa, incorporating data up to the conclusion of 2020."
