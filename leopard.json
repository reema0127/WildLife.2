        "para1" : "The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a leopard subspecies native to Sri Lanka. It was first described in 1956 by Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala.Since 2020, the Sri Lankan leopard has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as the population is estimated at less than 800 mature individuals, and is probably declining.The Sri Lankan leopard has a tawny or rusty yellow coat with dark spots and close-set rosettes. Seven females measured in the early 20th century averaged a weight of 64 lb (29 kg) and had a mean head-to-body-length of 1.04 m (3 ft 5 in) with a 77.5 cm (2 ft 6.5 in) long tail, the largest being 1.14 m (3 ft 9 in) with a 84 cm (2 ft 9 in) long tail; 11 males averaged 56 kg (124 lb), the largest being 77 kg (170 lb), and measured 1.27 m (4 ft 2 in) with a 86 cm (2 ft 10 in) long tail, the largest being 1.42 m (4 ft 8 in) with a 97 cm (3 ft 2 in) long tail.The Sri Lankan leopard has possibly evolved to become a rather large leopard subspecies, because it is the apex predator in the country. Large males have been suggested to reach almost 100 kg (220 lb), but evidence for this is lacking."

It is connected to Yala and is part of the same ecosystem.But due to the access and location, it is quite a long drive to reach compared to Yala. Kumana was initially famous as a bird sanctuary with many species of birds nesting in the waters of Kumana Villu."
